# Legal-Sentence-Classification
This project aims to explore classification of types in annotated sentences of documents from the US Board of Veteran's Appealsâ€™ decisions. Different segmenters are observed to select the optimal performing one, followed by tokenization and developing of a custom word embedding model from an unlabeled corpus. Finally, different models are used using TFIDF and word embedding featurizations to find the best performing according to some metrics.

* **Literature-Survey**: Carried out over different papers which use sentence classification on legal texts. An analysis of their methods and results are included at the end.
* **Project-Report**: Document of the comprehensive analysis done at every step of the project as well as discussions on the findings.

A requirements file with necessary libraries has been included.

The embedding model can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q33eX6H9GXz-Jtsz-DmwimhDHzbOKmRX/view?usp=sharing).

All the other files included are used to run the **Setup_and_Analyze** notebook which contains the required **analyze** function. The notebook has three cells to be run sequentially. The analyze function takes a string and returns a list of split sentences along with the name of types they have been classified as. The **Project_Code** notebook includes all cleaned code with the outputs cleared to perform the entire classification pipeline.
